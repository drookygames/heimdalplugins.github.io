Hey people of the internet. YOU can call me SYNACK,the reason i am making this repository is beacuase i as an old time hacker miss the times when the internet was ours.
when it was as normal to hack and improve programs, algorithims and software as it is easy today to signup to facebook.
i might have been a small kid back then but i do have to admit that most of the security implementations that are in use today have been made by hackers just like me
i want this site to be a home for hackers, whether white hats, black hats or script kiddies, without us the internet would not grow as it has in the past decade. 
now most of the old timers have given up hacking and this is the main reason for the slow down in develoment.
with huawei releasing the internet of things(aka 5G) our scope for hacking has just increased and it will keep on growing. we should use this site as a platform for connecting with
people who want to test their systems(clients) to hackers who want to legally keep on practicing hacking, this is the most viable way to keep hacking on the mainstream.
and ofcourse the goal is to monitize hacking so that the blackhats don't have to be on the wrong side of the law.If we can be able to get clients to request us to test their systems
then we can as easily bring hacking back to the mai stream.
i will add a forum for discussions soon.please spread the word.
